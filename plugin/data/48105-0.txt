PREFACE


The present "Book of Quotations" was undertaken in the belief that,
notwithstanding the many excellent compilations of the kind already in
existence, there was room for another that should glean its materials
from a wider area, and that should have more respect to the
requirements, both speculative and practical, of the times we live in.
The wide-spread materials at command had never yet been collected into a
single volume, and certain modern writings, fraught with a wisdom that
supremely deserves our regard, had hardly been quarried in at all.

The Editor has therefore studied to compile a more comprehensive
collection; embracing something of this wisdom, which naturally bears
more directly on the interests of the present day. To these interests
the Editor has all along had an eye, and he has been careful to collect,
from ancient sources as well as modern, sayings that seem to reveal an
insight into them, and bear pertinently upon them; they are such as are
specified on the title-page, and they are one and all more than passing
ones. The aphorisms which wise men have uttered on these vital topics
can never fail to deserve our regard, and they will prove edifying to
us, even should we, led by a higher wisdom, be inclined to say nay to
them. For, as it has been said, "The errors of a wise man are more
instructive than the truths of a fool. The wise man travels in lofty,
far-seeing regions; the fool in low-lying, high-fenced lanes; retracing
the footsteps of the former, to discover where he deviated, whole
provinces of the universe are laid open to us; in the path of the
latter, granting even that he has not deviated at all, little is laid
open to us but two wheel-ruts and two hedges."

The quotations collected in this book, (particularly those bearing on
the vital interests referred to,) are, it will be generally admitted,
the words of wise men; therefore the Editor has endeavoured to ascertain
and give the names of their authors, when not known. For, though the
truth and worth of the sayings are nowise dependent on their authorship,
it is well to know who those were that felt the burden they express,
and found relief in uttering them. What was of moment to them, may well
be of moment to others, and must be worthy of all regard and well
deserving of being laid to heart.

Except in the case of quotations from Shakespeare, the reader will
observe that the Editor has quoted only the names of the authors or the
books from which they are taken, and has not, as might be expected of
him, supplied either chapter or verse. The reason is, he did not think
it worth the labour and expense that would have been involved in doing
so, while the quotations given are for most part independent of the
context, and are perfectly intelligible in their own light. They are all
more or less of an aphoristic quality, and the meaning and application
are evident to any one who understands the subject of which they treat.

As for the other qualities of these quotations, they will be found to be
in general brief in expression and pointed in application, and not a few
of them winged as well as barbed. A great many are pregnant in meaning;
suggest more than they express; and are the coinage of minds of no
ordinary penetration and grasp of thought. While some of them are so
simple that a child might understand them, there are others that border
on regions in which the clearest-headed and surest-footed might stumble
and come to grief.

The collection might have been larger; the quarry of the literature of
the present century alone might have supplied materials for as big a
book. But the Editor's task was to produce a work that should embrace
gleanings from different fields of literature, and he could only
introduce from that of the present day as much as his limits allowed.
Yet, though the quantity given is no index of the quantity available,
the Editor hopes the reader will allow that his selection has not been
made in the dark, and that what he has given is of the true quality, as
well as enough in quantity for most readers to digest. If the quality be
good, the quantity is of little account, for what has been said of
Reason may be said of Wisdom which is its highest expression: "Whoso
hath any, hath access to the whole."

A word of explanation in regard to the Arrangement and the appended
Index:--

The Arrangement adopted may not at once commend itself, but it was found
to be the best; a topical one would have been too cumbersome, as, in
that case, it would have been frequently necessary to introduce the same
quotation under several different heads. The arrangement, it will be
seen, is alphabetical, and follows the order of the initial letters of
the initial word or words.

The Index, which is topical, was rendered necessary in consequence of
the arrangement followed, and, though a copious one, it only refers to
subjects of which there is anything of significance said. It does not
include mottoes, and rarely proverbs; for, apart from the difficulty of
indexing the latter, the attempt would almost have doubled the size of
the book, and rendered it altogether unwieldy. The Index, too, is
limited to subjects that are not in the alphabetical order in the body
of the book. Thus there was no need to index what is said on "Art," on
p. 18, on "Beauty," on p. 26, or on "Christianity," on pp. 42, 43, as
the reader will expect to find something concerning them where they
occur in the order adopted.

With these preliminary explanations the Editor leaves his book--the
pleasant labour of more than three years--in the hands of the public,
assured that they will judge of it by its own merits, and that they will
be generous enough to acquit him of having compiled either a superfluous
or an unserviceable work.

laws. In his solicitude as to his approaching
lot, he has neither time nor desire to raise
his eyes to the heavens to watch and record
their phenomena; no leisure to look upon
himself and consider what and where he
is. In the imperious demand for a present

=Man is the weeping animal born to govern
all the rest.= _Pliny._

good mother, / Nor customary suits of solemn
black. / Nor windy suspiration of forced
breath, / No, nor the fruitful river in the eye, /

Together with all forms, modes, shows of
grief, / That can denote truly; these, indeed,
seem, / For they are actions that a
man can play: / But I have that within,
which passeth show; / These but the trappings
and the suits of woe.= _Ham._, i. 2.

=Shakespeare carries us to such a lofty strain
of intelligent activity as to suggest a wealth
that beggars his own; and we then feel that
the splendid works which he has created,
and which in other hours we extol as a sort
of self-existent poetry, have no stronger
hold of real nature than the shadow of a
passing traveller on the rock.= _Emerson._

=Shakespeare does not look at a thing merely,
but into it, through it, so that he constructively
comprehends it, can take it asunder
and put it together again; the thing melts,
as it were, into light under his eye, and
anew creates itself before him.= _Carlyle._

=Shakespeare is dangerous to young poets;
they cannot but reproduce him, while they
imagine they are producing themselves.=
_Goethe._

=Shakespeare is no sectarian; to all he deals=                        10
=with equity and mercy; because he knows
all, and his heart is wide enough for all. In
his mind the world is a whole; he figures it
as Providence governs it; and to him it is
not strange that the sun should be caused to
shine on the evil and the good, and the rain
to fall on the just and the unjust.= _Carlyle._

=Shakespeare is the greatest intellect who, in
our recorded world, has left record of himself
in the way of literature. I know not
such power of vision, such faculty of thought
in any other man, such calmness of depth;
placid joyous strength; all things imaged in
that great soul of his so true and clear, as
in a tranquil unfathomable sea. A perfectly
level mirror, that is to say withal, a
man justly related to all things and men, a
good man.= _Carlyle._

=Shakespeare says we are creatures that look=                         15
=before and after; the more surprising that
we do not look round a little and see what is
passing under our very eyes.= _Carlyle._

=Shakespeare stands alone. His want of erudition

ignorance; it forced him back upon his
own resources, which were exhaustless.=
_Colton._

=Shakespeare, the finest human figure, as I apprehend,
that Nature has hitherto seen fit

clay. I find no human soul so beautiful, these
fifteen hundred known years--our supreme
modern European man.= _Carlyle._

=Shakespeare, the sage and seer of the human
heart.= _H. Giles._

=Shakespeare was forbidden of heaven to have
any plans.... Not for him the founding of
institutions, the preaching of doctrines, or
the repression of abuses. Neither he, nor
the sun, did on any morning that they rose
together, receive charge from their Maker
concerning such things. They were both of
them to shine on the evil and good; both to
behold unoffendingly all that was upon the
earth, to burn unappalled upon the spears of
kings, and undisdaining upon the reeds of
the river.= _Ruskin._

=Shakespeare= (it is true) =wrote perfect historical=                 20
=plays on subjects belonging to the preceding
centuries,= (but) =they are perfect plays just
because there is no care about centuries in
them, but a life which all men recognise for
the human life of all time; ... a rogue in
the fifteenth century being, at heart, what a
rogue is in the nineteenth and was in the
twelfth; and an honest or a knightly man
being, in like manner, very similar to other
such at any other time.= _Ruskin._

hue than one which inspires terror.= _W. v.

receives.= _H. Lecky._

=The mind of the greatest man on earth is not

feel inconvenienced by the merest buzzing
noise about him; it does not need the report

nothing.= _Mme. Swetchine._

=We expect in letters to discover somewhat=                           45
=of a person's real character. It is childish
indeed to expect that we are to find the
whole heart of the author unveiled....
Still as letters from one friend to another
make the nearest approaches to conversation,
we may expect to see more of a
character displayed in these than in other
productions which are studied for public
view.= _Blair._

=We expect old men to be conservative, but
when a nation's young men are so, its
funeral-bell is already rung.= _Ward Beecher._

=We forfeit three-fourths of ourselves in order
to be like other people.= _Schopenhauer._

the fancies of others, and according to

whole human family is bathed with an
element of love like a fine ether.= _Emerson._

_Oliver H. Perry._

=We have more indolence in the mind than in
the body.= _La Roche._

=We have more mathematics than ever, but less
mathesis. Archimedes and Plato could not
have read the "Méchanique Céleste;" but
neither would the whole French Institute see
aught in that saying, "God geometrises," but
sentimental rhodomontade.= _Carlyle._

=We have no more / The world to choose from,=                         35

=we have feet to scale and climb / By slow
degrees, by more and more, / The cloudy

in space (or possibly may happen in time);
we have only to attend to what is happening

as long as man is mortal and unhappy.= _Wm.
Smith._

=We have scotch'd the snake, but not killed
it.= _Macb._, iii. 2.

=We have such exorbitant eyes, that, on seeing

fragment of an arc which we first beheld.=
_Emerson._

prayers.= _Ant. and Cleo._, ii. 1.

yet shall sing; / Because to sing is human,
and high thought / Grows rhythmic ere its
close.= _Lewis Morris._

=We inherit, not life only, but all the garniture
and form of life; and work, and speak, and
even think and feel, as our fathers, and
primeval grandfathers, from the beginning,
have given it us.= _Carlyle._

=We injure mysteries, which are matters of
faith, by any attempt at explanation in order
to make them matters of reason. Could
they be explained, they would cease to be
mysteries; and it has been well said that a
thing is not necessarily against reason because
it happens to be above it.= _Colton._

subjects knows them but half and superficially.=
_Goethe._

=We learn to know a thing best in the place
where it is native.= _Goethe._

=We learn to know nothing but what we love;

any matter with insight, the stronger and
more vital must our love and passion be.=
_Goethe._

=We learn wisdom from failure much more than=                         15
=from success; we often discover what will
do by finding out what will not do; and probably
he who never made a mistake never
made a discovery. Horne Tooke used to
say of his studies in intellectual philosophy,
that he had become all the better acquainted
with the country through having had the
good luck sometimes to lose his way.= _Smiles._

=We lie down and rise up with the skeleton
allotted to us for our mortal companion--the
phantom of ourselves.= _Dickens._

=We like only such actions as have long already

that anything man can do may be
divinely done.= _Emerson._

desire is to be tempted enough.= _Hare._

=We like to see through others, but not that
others should see through us.= _La Roche._

=We live by admiration, hope, and love; / And=                        20

dignity of being we ascend.= _Wordsworth._

=We live by our imaginations, by our admirations,
by our sentiments.= _Emerson._

=We live in a real, and a solid, and a truthful
world. In such a world only truth, in the
long run, can hope to prosper.= _Prof. Blackie._

=We live in a world which is full of misery and
ignorance, and the plain duty of each and
all of us is to try to make the little corner
he can influence somewhat less miserable
and somewhat less ignorant than it was
before he entered it. To do this effectually,
it is necessary to be fully possessed of only
two beliefs: the first, that the order of
nature is ascertainable by our faculties to an
extent which is practically unlimited; the
second, that our volition counts for something
as a condition of the course of events.=
_Huxley._

=We live in deeds, not years; in thoughts, not
breaths; / In feelings, not in figures on a
dial.= _Bailey._ (?)

Yet cannot use even what within it lies.=

is not; / E'en our sincerest laughter / With
some pain is fraught; / Our sweetest songs
are those which tell of saddest thought.=
_Shelley._

=We love a girl for very different things than=                       30
=understanding. We love her for her beauty,
her youth, her mirth, her confidingness, her
character, with its faults, caprices, and God
knows what other inexpressible charms; but
we do not love her for her understanding. Her
mind we esteem (if it is brilliant), and it may
greatly elevate her in our opinion; nay,
more, it may enchain us when we already
love. But her understanding is not that
which awakens and inflames our passions.=
_Goethe._

=We love in others what we lack ourselves, /
And would be everything but what we are.=
_R. H. Stoddart._

=We love justice greatly, and just men but
little.= _Joseph Roux._

=We love peace, as we abhor pusillanimity;
but not peace at any price. There is a
peace more destructive of the manhood of
living man than war is destructive of his
material body. Chains are worse than
bayonets.= _Douglas Jerrold._

=We love those who admire us, but not those
whom we admire.= _La Roche._

into seeming knowledge, when we
should submit ourselves to an unknown fear.=
_All's Well_, ii. 3.

=We make way for the man who boldly pushes
past us.= _Bovee._

=We manufacture everything there= (in our manufacturing
cities) =except men; we blanch cotton,
and strengthen steel, and refine sugar, and
shape pottery; but to brighten, to strengthen,
to refine, or to form a single living
spirit, never enters into our estimate of advantages.=
_Ruskin._

=We may acquire liberty, but it is never recovered
if it is once lost.= _Rousseau._

=We may all agree in lamenting that there are
so many houses where you will not find a
good atlas, a good dictionary, or a good
cyclopædia of reference. What is still more
lamentable, in a good many more houses
where these books are, is that they are
never referred to or opened.= _John Morley._

=We may almost say that a new life begins
when a man once sees with his own eyes
all that before he has but partially read or
heard of.= _Goethe._

=We may be as good as we please, if we please
to be good.= _Barrow._

Fill our rooms with paintings and with sculptures,/
But we cannot / Buy with gold the
old associations!= _Longfellow._

wealth to buy gentility, but very few

nature, and (in the best sense of the word)
constitute a gentleman.= _Shenstone._

=We may despise the world, but we cannot do
without it.= _Baron Wessenberg._

=We may fall in with a thousand learned men

it into a vice.= _Montaigne._

=We may have a law, or we may have no law,

=We may have once been slugs, and may one
day be angels, but we are men now; and
we must, as men, do our work honourably and
thoroughly.= _Ruskin._

=We may lay in a stock of pleasures, as we
would lay in a stock of wine; but if we defer
the tasting of them too long, we shall find
that both are soured by age.= _Colton._

=We may not be able to parry evil thoughts, but
we may surely guard against their taking root
in us and bringing forth evil deeds.= _Luther._

=We may outrun / By violent swiftness that
which we run at, / And lose by overrunning.=
_Hen. VIII._, i. 1.

=We may say of angling as Dr. Boteler said
of strawberries, "Doubtless God could have
made a better berry, but doubtless God
never did;" and so, if I might be judge, God
never did make a more calm, quiet, innocent
recreation than angling.= _Izaak Walton._

=We may seek God by our intellect= (_Verstand_),
=but we can find him only with the
heart.= _Cötvös._

=We mount to heaven mostly on the ruins of
our cherished schemes, finding our failures
were successes.= _A. B. Alcott._

=We move too much in platoons; we march
by sections; we do not live in our vital individuality
enough; we are slaves to fashion,
in mind and in heart, if not to our passions
and appetites.= _Chapin._

=We must accept ourselves as we are.= _Scherer._

=We must accept the post to which Heaven
appoints us, and do the duty to which
Heaven calls us, and think it no shame,
but an honour, to hold any office, however
lowly, under heaven's King.= _Ed._

=We must all receive and learn both from those=                       25

with us. Even the greatest genius would not
go far if he tried to owe everything to his
own internal self.= _Goethe._

=We must all toil--or steal; no faithful workman
finds his life a pastime.= _Carlyle._

it is moderate, is a virtue; but when it is
carried to an extreme, it narrows the mind.=
_Fénelon._

=We must be as courteous to a man as we are
to a picture, which we are willing to give the
advantage of a good light.= _Emerson._

noble heart will bear injustice.= _Schiller._

=We must carry the beautiful with us, or we

a favourable and cheerful height; meanwhile,
let us see how we can stroll through

=have a science of the thing.= _Froude._

=We must hold by what is definite, and not
split up our strength in many directions.=
_Hegel._

=We must, if we would husband life and not
waste it, bravely resolve to dispense with
the dispensable, to content ourselves with
the minimum of want, to stake our reputation,

worth, and show once again, if we can, by
our mere life and labour, what are the "roots
of honour" and the "veins of wealth."= _Ed._

it meekly.= _Ward Beecher._

=We must not contradict, but instruct, him that
contradicts us.= _Antisthenes._

state in which they leave their country at
their death or at their fall.= _Mme. de Staël._

=We must not make a scarecrow of the law.=
_Meas. for Meas._, ii. 1.

=We must not only strike the iron while it is

what the truth will say.= _Plato._

=We must not suppose ourselves always to have

=We must take the world as we find it.= _Pr._

=We need change of objects.= _Emerson._

=We= (in England) =need examples of people who,
leaving Heaven to decide whether they are
to rise in the world, decide for themselves
that they will be happy in it, and have resolved
to seek--not greater wealth, but
simpler pleasure; not higher fortune, but
deeper felicity; making the first of possessions
self-possession, and honouring themselves
in the harmless pride and calm pursuits

nature is to deceive alike on the one side
the sinner and on the other the judge.=
_Ruskin._

=We never can say why we love, but only that we
love. The heart is ready enough at feigning

wrong; but ask it to give a reason for any
of its beautiful and divine motions, and it can
only look upward and be dumb.= _Lowell._

=We never live, but we hope to live; and as we
are always arranging for being happy, it
cannot be but that we never are so.= _Pascal._

=We never love truly but once. It is the first
time. Succeeding passions are less involuntary.=
_Du Cœur._

exulting in our choice; while he who has
bound us to him by benefits alone rises to
our idea as a person to whom we have, in
some measure, forfeited our freedom.= _Goldsmith._

=We never see anything isolated in Nature,=                           25
=but everything in connection with something
else which is before it, beside it, under
it, and over it.= _Goethe._

=We never sufficiently consider that a language
is properly only symbolical, only figurative,
and expresses objects never immediately,
but only in reflection; yet how difficult it is

with ourselves and with others.= _Goethe._

=We ought not to judge men by their absolute
excellence, but by the distance which they
have travelled from the point at which they
started.= _Ward Beecher._

enemy; but I will remember, and this I owe

=We should have all our communications with
men as in the presence of God; and with
God, as in the presence of men.= _Colton._

our praise or censure on mankind, since we

evil in the same character, that it may require
a very accurate judgment and a very
elaborate inquiry to determine on which side
the balance turns.= _Fielding._

=We should not spur a willing horse.= _Pr._                           40

=We should not trust the heart too much. The
heart speaks to us very gladly, as our mouth
expresses itself. If the mouth were as much
inclined to speak the feelings of the heart,
it would have been the fashion long ago to
put a padlock on the mouth.= _Lessing._

=We should often feel ashamed of our most
brilliant actions were the world to see the
motives from which they sprung.= _La Roche._

should keep within ourselves, and they will

with an evening of thought. We learn
nothing of our experience except we muse
upon it.= _Bovee._

invented them.= _Emerson._

=We sometimes see a change of expression in
our companion, and say, His father or his
mother comes to the windows of his eyes,

hours, a man represents each of several of
his ancestors, as if there were seven or eight
of us rolled up in each man's skin--seven or
eight ancestors at least--and they constitute
the variety of notes for that new piece of
music which his life is.= _Emerson._

=We speak that we do know, and testify that
we have seen.= _Jesus._

seek for gain, to shrink from loss, / Content

us, but only drop by drop a truth which is
bitter to us.= _Diderot._

=We take a great deal for granted in this world,=                     15
=and expect that everything, as a matter of
course, ought to fit into our humours, wishes,
and wants; it is often only when danger
threatens that we awake to the discovery
that the guiding reins are held by one whom
we had well-nigh forgotten in our careless
ease.= _Mrs. Gatty._

=We take a pleasure in being severe upon
others, but cannot endure to hear of our own
faults.= _Thomas à Kempis._

that we are happy than in endeavouring to
think so ourselves.= _Confucius._

the morning star.= _Emerson._

Browning._

=We trample grass, and prize the flowers of
May; / Yet grass is green when flowers do
fade away.= _R. Southwell._

his will on slight occasions.= _Ruskin._

=We triumph without glory when we conquer
without danger.= _Corn._

=We unconsciously imitate what pleases us,
and insensibly approximate to the characters
we most admire. In this way, a generous
habit of thought and of action carries with
it an incalculable influence.= _Bovee._

=We underpin our houses with granite; what=                           30

been a yesterday, and to-morrow is coming.=

=We want downright facts at present more
than anything else.= _Ruskin._

=We want foolishly to think the creed a man
professes a more significant fact than the
man he is.= _Thoreau._

=We want one man to be always thinking, and
another to be always working, and we call
the one a gentleman, and the other an operative;
whereas the workman ought often to
be thinking, and the thinker often to be
working, and both should be gentlemen in
the best sense.= _Ruskin._

=We waste our best years in distilling the
sweetest flowers of life into potions which,
after all, do not immortalise, but only intoxicate.=

=this is almost always difficult, for we believe
others to be happier than they are.= _Montesquieu._

=We would commend a faith that even seems
audacious, like that of the sturdy Covenanter
Robert Bruce, who requested, as he was
dying, that his finger might be placed on
one of God's strong promises, as though to
challenge the Judge of all with it as he
should enter his presence.= _Dr. Gordon._

=We wound our modesty and make foul the
clearness of our deservings when of ourselves
we publish them.= _All's Well_, i. 3.

better fortune, and turn away our eyes, lest
the wants and woes of our brother-mortals
should disturb the selfish apathy of our
souls.= _Burns._

=We write from aspiration and antagonism, as
well as from experience. We paint those
qualities which we do not possess.= _Emerson._

=We'd jump the life to come. But, in these=                           10
=cases, / We still have judgment here; that

=Weaknesses, so called, are neither more nor
less than vice in disguise.= _Lavater._

human flesh. Famine and gluttony alike
drive nature away from the heart of man.=
_Theodore Parker._

=Wealth is not his that has it, but his that
enjoys it.= _Ben. Franklin._

order, in timeliness, in being at the right
spot.= _Emerson._

=Wealth is the conjuror's devil; / Whom when he
thinks he hath, the devil hath him.= _Herbert._

of universal being.= _Carlyle._

=Wealth which breeds idleness, of which the
English peerage is an example, and of which
we are beginning to abound in specimens in
this country= (America), =is only a sort of human
oyster-bed, where heirs and heiresses are
planted, to spend a contemptible life of

=Wealth without contentment climbs a hill, /
To feel those tempests which fly over

pleasure.= _George Sand._

=Work is of a religious nature,--work is of
a brave nature, which it is the aim of all
religion to be. "All work of man is as the
swimmer's." A waste ocean threatens to
devour him; if he front it not bravely, it
will keep its word. By incessant wise defiance
of it, lusty rebuke and buffet of it,
behold how it loyally supports him,--bears
him as its conqueror along! "It is so," says
Goethe, "with all things that man undertakes
in this world."= _Carlyle._

the true source of human welfare.= _Tolstoi._

=Work is the mission of man on this planet.=
_Carlyle._

=Work is the only universal currency which
God accepts. A nation's welfare will depend
on its ability to master the world; that, on
power of work; that, on its power of thought.=
_Theodore Parker._

=Work, properly so called, is an appeal from
the Seen to the Unseen--a devout calling
upon Higher Powers; and unless they stand
by us, it will not be a work, but a quackery.=
_Carlyle._

=Work till the last beam fadeth, / Fadeth to
shine no more; / Work while the night is
darkening, / When man's work is o'er.=

and band, / Band, and gusset, and seam, /
Till over the buttons I fall asleep, / And sew
them on in a dream.= _Hood._

=Works of true merit are seldom very popular
in their own day; for knowledge is on the
march, and men of genius are the "præstolatores"
or "videttes," that are far in advance
of their comrades. They are not with them,
but before them; not in the camp, but beyond
it.= _Colton._

=Worldly affairs, which my friends thought so=                        10

we know ourselves.= _Law._

are torn in getting them, many a tooth
broke in cracking them, but never a belly
filled with eating them.= _R. Venning._

=Worse than being fool'd / Of others, is to fool
one's self.= _Tennyson._

=Worse than despair, / Worse than the bitterness
of death, is hope; / It is the only ill
which can find place / Upon the giddy, sharp,
and narrow hour / Tottering beneath us.=
_Shelley._

=Worship is transcendent wonder; wonder for

at diamond prices, but then no one would
use the article second-hand!= _Balzac._

=Would we but pledge ourselves to truth as
heartily as we do to a real or imaginary
mistress, and think life too short only because
it abridges our time of service, what

=Wouldst thou plant for eternity? then plant=                         30

year and day? then plant into his shallow
superficial faculties, his self-love and arithmetical
understanding, what will grow there.=

=heard.= _George Herbert._

=Write thy wrongs in ashes.= _Sir T. Browne._

=Writers of novels and romances in general
bring a double loss on their readers--they
rob them both of their time and money; representing
men, manners, and things, that never
have been, nor are likely to be; either confounding
or perverting history and truth,
inflating the mind, or committing violence
upon the understanding.= _Mary Wortley
Montagu._

=Writing is not literature unless it gives to the

_Carlyle._

=Wrongs are often forgiven, but contempt
never is. Our pride remembers it for ever.
It implies a discovery of weaknesses, which
we are much more careful to conceal than
crimes. Many a man will confess his crimes
to a common friend, but I never knew a man
who would tell his silly weaknesses to his
most intimate one.= _Chesterfield._

Its pictures are not in black and sombre

=Ye stars! which are the poetry of heaven!...
In our aspirations to be great, / Our destinies

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
